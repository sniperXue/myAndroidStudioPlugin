# Android Tests Recorder
This is a plugin to [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) that allows to start application, 
record user interactions and then generate test class sources for [Espresso Tests Framework](http://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html) that will reproduce 
those user interactions.

As result it saves developers time to write such tests. Developer can create test skeleton with this tool and then add necessary test logic.
